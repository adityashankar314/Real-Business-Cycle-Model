# Real-Business-Cycle-

This is a Real Business Cycle model based on stochastic growth.

Worked with Professor Fabio Ghironi at the University of Washington - Seattle.

In the stochastic growth model, fluctuations are the result of random shocks to technology and economic outcomes are efficient

The difficulty in solving the model is a fundamental non-linearity that arises from the interaction between multiplicative elements, such as Cobb-Douglas production, and additive elements, such as capital accumulation and depreciation.
  - This non-linearity makes it impossible, in general, to solve the model without resorting to some kind of approximation.


In my model, I model the response of economic growth to shocks in endogenous labor supply.
